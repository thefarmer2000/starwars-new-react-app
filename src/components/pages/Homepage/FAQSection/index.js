                The Battle of Haku offers several unique characters with upgradeable abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. There are currently two characters, the Monks and the Dark Valley Ninjas.
                <br/><b>The Monks:</b>
                They are tenacious warriors born to serve the spirit of Haku and armed with the vast knowledge of the Temple. They serve to maintain the order on Mount Haku and are the protectors of the light deep within. They are ferocious warriors geared to attain enlightenment with $Haku but are sometimes lured into the shadows when they choose to abandon the temple. They only gain their strength and multiply in number when they maintain $Haku within their reach.
                <br/><b>The Dark Valley Ninjas:</b>
                They are the counterparts of the Monks.They are skilled at harnessing the power of the Monks who abandon the temple. They are adept at mastering new weapons and lurk in the shadows of Mount Haku to kidnap the Monks and steal their $Haku. They frequently change their tactics to beguile the Monks and do anything to win the battle.
